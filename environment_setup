3. Setting up SQLite3 databse to Work with Python 3
----------------------------------------------------

i) Download the following packages from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
Pre-complied binaries for Windows - sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3230100.zip and sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3230100.zip
ii) Create a folder C:\sqlite3 and extract the contents there - keep only the binaries to make a clean directory structure:

e.g. C:\sqlite3
			|______ sqldiff
			|______ sqlite3.def
			|______ sqlite3.dll
			|______ sqlite3
			|______  sqlite3_analyzer

3. Add C:\sqlite3 in PATH environment variable
4. Open command prompt (or power shell window) and type: sqlite3 [hit return]. This will open sqlite prompt. To exit type .exit [hit return]
5. A very well written article - http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_sqlite_in_python_tutorial.html
